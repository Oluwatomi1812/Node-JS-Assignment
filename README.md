1) Monolithic Architecture is an architecture where all components of the software operate as a single unified unit and there is no separation . It is described as an 'All-in-one' architecture

2) Microservice Architecture is an architecture where the software (usually a large application) is broken down into a collection of small independent sevices.
Let's take the example of the Bank; A Bank is split into different branches that specialize in different services; creating account, withdrawals, taking loans etc. This is similar to the microservice architecture.

3)The Microservice Architecture appeals to me. This is because it is easier to maintain and test, it has better scalability, easier to find error(debug) which makes it more reliable.

4) Yes! Although Node.js executes JavaScript code in a single thread(one task at a time), Node.js itself is multithreaded.

5) REPL - Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
